## 📱 Project Overview

This is a personal learning journey where I dive into the fundamentals and best practices of **iOS app development** using:
- **Swift**: Apple's powerful, intuitive programming language
- **SwiftUI**: A modern declarative framework to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms

The goal is to learn how to build apps the **Apple way** – fast, clean, and beautiful.
